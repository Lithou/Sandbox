# Brain Dump of Ideas

- have a table off to the side in the margin that is fixed for summary info (think wikipedia's side bar.)
- border radius and clip path to make distinct blocks of each heading/subheading
	- break on a specific heading level? 
	- H1 always sepparate, H2 or H3 controls distinct blocks
- Find a way to make columns work well
- solidify using a pipe to call arguments for images and embeds 
	- regex of "contains" for each
	- don't need all combinations, just each option
	- use like arguments/flags "test.jpg| -left -small -bordered -margin"
- Work with CSS on tables to make unique structures
	- can you make TR and TD change position?
	- can you make a TD position absolute 
	- Title a heading? (Col span maybe?)
- apply attributes to all divs to transclude children together. 
	- Would allow images inline with a paragraph
	- potentially better control over breaks
	- can limit to one type of class
- CSS page class as arguments for snippets
	- can you use contains argument for class? 
	- allow multiple options for handling preview
- Transparent Image options
