## Elements with multiple classes
To change the color of the note spines I have used this:

```css
body.plugin-sliding-panes .view-header {
    background-color: #f2f8fd;
}
```
only want this applied to the Light mode. But if I add `.theme-light` as a line above the "body" line it does not work. Is there another way to make it Light-mode-only applicable?
``` css
.theme-light body.plugin-sliding-panes .view-header { 
	background-color: #f2f8fd; 
}
```



## tab-header-container
Klass: 
In the left hand pane I have managed to change the background color to a light blue, except for that top strip with the 3 tabs. I tried this:
 ```css
.theme-light .workspace-tab-header-container { 
 	background-color: #f2f8fd; 
}
 ```
 
 
 
 ## H1 and Titlebar duplication
 Nikoz: 
I noticed that the **note** title is different from the Heading 1 within the note. 
Not sure if my approach ==is== correct but I feel the need to have them being the same in terms of content/writing. 

Why is that?
1. I need the title for the searches (Ctrtl+O).
2. I need a big Heading1 at the very beginning of my notes for better, more engaging readability and clarity. I understand the Heading1 is not taken into account in the searches with Ctrl+O.

- manual method
- template
- python script
- dropshadow/larger title bar

## Edit Font
Mognoo
Hi Everyone, I'm new to Obsidian but eager to start working with it. But I always use fixed width fonts when editing Markdown... How can I change my Edit Pane font to a fixed width font already installed on my Win10 OS? I Looked on the Obsidian 'Help' and 'Forum' but could not understand a word, I'm afraid... Help, Anyone?

## Customize Themes
Tansy: Basically I want to be able to have the look of Obsidian Nord (have both a light and dark theme) but have these colours


## Clean Edit Theme
Tansy: Hey - I like the Obsidian Nord theme - however, I was wondering if anyone could help me.... I want to have the # not show like in the Obunto theme

## Snippet Mechanics and Naming Conventions
TheSourcerer: How would you name the snippets? Any guides on this I can reference?

so the snippets are basically the .css code as individual edits to the currently selected .css theme, separated into different .css files for each edit?

mdbraber: are CSS snippets supposed to override theme based settingss?


## Apply themes per-file
Oliver Marseus:
Would it be possible to have certain visual themes apply only to certain tagged files/ backlined files / under specific folders?

## Pull out menu items
 zalenza: Does anyone know how to move one of the note menu items out of the menu so it’s always visible? For example, always show the pin icon. I’ve been messing around and all I’ve been able to do is manipulate the icons that are already visible.
 
## code-block background colors
  grio: anyone know the css selector, to customize the background color of inline-code-blocks?
  
  This is an `inline code` block
```css
  .cm-s-obsidian span.cm-inline-code:not(.cm-formatting):not(.cm-hmd-indented-code):not(.obsidian-search-match-highlight) {

 background-color: darkblue

}

.cm-s-obsidian span.cm-inline-code {

 background-color: darkblue;

}
```
